# Yani — Modular Download Service

Anime search → resolve → download, with pluggable sources and reliable job orchestration.

The goal is to provide a simple, modular, and reliable solution for downloading anime.

## Why this exists
I wanted to create a solution that would allow me to:
- easily __download__ anime from multiple sources
- with stable metadata normalization (without title/alias chaos).

## TODO
- [ ] Search from multiple sources with metadata normalization
- [ ] Download in parallel with job orchestration
